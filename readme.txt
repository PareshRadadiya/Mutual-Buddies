Mutual buddies displays BuddyPress mutual friends of the logged in user & the user whose profile the user is looking at on the Profile page.

== Description ==

Are you looking for BuddyPress mutual friends? Mutual Buddies display a list of mutual friends on a BuddyPress member’s profile and members list

You can see which friends you have in common in your friends network. Like when you go to a friends profile you can see which persons your both friends with (common friends). Just like on Facebook. This plugin add a new component inside members's profile page and list all mutual friends.
